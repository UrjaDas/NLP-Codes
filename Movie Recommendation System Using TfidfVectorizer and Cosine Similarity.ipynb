    "Building a movie recommendation system can provide several benefits, both for businesses and users. Here are some reasons why building a movie recommendation system is valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhanced User Experience: Recommendation systems enhance user experience by providing personalized content suggestions. Users are more likely to engage with a platform that understands their preferences and recommends relevant movies.\n",
    "* Increased User Engagement: Recommending movies tailored to individual preferences can increase user engagement and retention. Users are more likely to spend more time on a platform that offers content they find interesting.\n",
    "* Content Discovery: Movie recommendation systems help users discover new content they might not have found otherwise. This is particularly beneficial in platforms with extensive libraries where users might be overwhelmed by choices.\n",
    "* Business Revenue: For streaming platforms or movie rental services, a good recommendation system can lead to increased revenue. When users discover and watch more content, it can result in higher subscription rates or additional rental fees.\n",
    "* Competitive Advantage: A well-designed recommendation system can provide a competitive advantage in the entertainment industry. Users are drawn to platforms that offer a personalized and enjoyable experience.\n",
    "* Customer Satisfaction: By providing personalized recommendations, platforms can improve overall customer satisfaction. Users appreciate services that cater to their individual preferences and interests.\n",
    "* Data Utilization: Building a recommendation system involves analyzing user behavior and preferences. This data can be valuable for understanding customer behavior, improving content offerings, and making data-driven business decisions."

    "* Around 844 Movies don't have a tagline, so its better to not include it in the analysis. There seems to be a few features that could be helpful in determining the similarity between the movies and hence in recommendation. The features that look promising are 'genres', 'keywords','popularity', 'revenue', 'vote_average'. 'Original_Language' could have been included one-hot encoded had the number of language categories been smaller, but there are way too many languages to consider that possibility.  \n",
    "* 'Genres' and 'Keywords' tells in about the characteristics of a particular movie which could play a major role in drawing similarity between two movies. These two features store textual information and hence they are first converted into a single string (since TFIDFVectorizer/ CountVectorizer takes data into a single string format and treat each row as a single document) and transforms them into vectors. Maximum 2000 features are considered and hence there will be 2000 rows.\n",
    "* The other features, namely 'popularity', 'revenue', 'vote_average' contain numerical values. A new dataframe containing values of these features are created. The features are then scaled using the MinMaxScaler so that larger values do not impact the accuracy. This dataframe is concatenated with the transformed vector. \n",
    "* Cosine similarity is computed between each pair of vectors. The resultant scores are arranged in descending order and top 5 movies leaving the first one (first one is the cosine similarity score of the movie wth itself) are recommended to a particular user.\n"
